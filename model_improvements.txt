NVIDIA Stock Price Prediction Model - Technical Improvements and Features

1. Data Collection Enhancements
----------------------------
- Extended Historical Data: Increased from 1 year to 2 years of historical data
  * Benefit: More training data for better pattern recognition
  * Impact: Improved model stability and reduced edge effects in technical indicators

- Synthetic Sentiment Analysis
  * Original: Used neutral (0) sentiment scores
  * Improved: Implemented random normal distribution (mean=0, std=0.2) for sentiment
  * Benefit: More realistic simulation of market sentiment variations

2. Technical Indicators
--------------------
Implemented comprehensive technical analysis with:
a) Moving Averages
   - MA5 (5-day moving average)
   - MA20 (20-day moving average)
   * Purpose: Trend identification and support/resistance levels

b) RSI (Relative Strength Index)
   - 14-day period
   - Improved NaN handling with neutral value (50)
   * Purpose: Overbought/oversold conditions

c) MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
   - Fast EMA: 12 periods
   - Slow EMA: 26 periods
   * Purpose: Trend direction and momentum

3. Feature Engineering Improvements
-------------------------------
- Lag Features
  * Reduced from [1,2,3,5,7,14,21] to [1,2,3,5,7]
  * Benefit: Better balance between information and noise
  * Applied to both price and volume

- Additional Features
  * Daily Returns: Price percentage changes
  * Volatility: 20-day rolling standard deviation
  * Combined Sentiment: Integration of synthetic sentiment scores

4. Data Processing Enhancements
----------------------------
- Improved NaN Handling
  * Original: Simple forward fill
  * Improved: Combined forward and backward fill
  * Benefit: No data loss at edges

- Rolling Window Optimization
  * Reduced from 60 to 30 days
  * Benefit: More responsive to recent market changes
  * Impact: Better short-term prediction accuracy

5. Model Architecture Improvements
------------------------------
- Prediction Horizon
  * Changed from 5-day to 1-day forecast
  * Benefit: More precise short-term predictions

- XGBoost Parameters
  * max_depth: 5 (balanced tree depth)
  * learning_rate: 0.1 (moderate learning speed)
  * n_estimators: 100 (sufficient number of trees)
  * min_child_weight: 3 (reduced overfitting)
  * subsample: 0.8 (robust sampling)
  * colsample_bytree: 0.8 (feature sampling)

6. Error Handling and Validation
-----------------------------
- Data Sufficiency Checks
  * Minimum window size validation
  * Historical data availability checks
  * Date alignment verification

- Performance Metrics
  * RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  * MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  * RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

7. Visualization Improvements
--------------------------
- Combined Price and Prediction Plot
  * Actual vs Predicted prices
  * Clear date labeling
  * Grid for better readability

8. Future Improvements Possible
----------------------------
1. Real sentiment data integration
2. Additional technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator)
3. Market sector correlation analysis
4. Volume-weighted indicators
5. Economic indicators integration

Note: This improved model focuses on practical implementation and robust prediction rather than complex optimization. The balance between model complexity and reliability makes it more suitable for real-world applications while maintaining good prediction accuracy.
